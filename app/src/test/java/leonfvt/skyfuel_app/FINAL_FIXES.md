# Final Fixes for SkyFuel App

## Fixed UI Compilation Issues

### 1. Missing Layout Modifiers
- Added missing imports for layout modifiers:
  ```kotlin
  import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.size
  ```

### 2. PullRefresh Implementation
- Added the Material Design dependency for pull-to-refresh:
  ```kotlin
  implementation(libs.androidx.compose.material)
  ```

- Updated the pull-to-refresh implementation:
  ```kotlin
  // Old implementation with errors
  val pullRefreshState = rememberPullToRefreshState()
  if (pullRefreshState.isRefreshing) { ... }
  
  // New implementation
  var refreshing by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
  val pullRefreshState = rememberPullRefreshState(
      refreshing = refreshing,
      onRefresh = { ... }
  )
  ```

- Fixed the PullRefreshIndicator:
  ```kotlin
  Box(
      modifier = Modifier
          .fillMaxSize()
          .pullRefresh(pullRefreshState)
  ) {
      // Add PullRefreshIndicator
      PullRefreshIndicator(
          refreshing = refreshing,
          state = pullRefreshState,
          modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.TopCenter)
      )
      // Content...
  }
  ```

- Added required OptIn annotation:
  ```kotlin
  @OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3Api::class, ExperimentalMaterialApi::class)
  ```

### 3. Java Time API Support
- Added Java 8 desugaring support in build.gradle.kts
- Added ThreeTenABP dependency for Java 8 time APIs on older Android
- Updated the SkyFuelApplication class to initialize ThreeTenABP

### 4. Material Icons
- Replaced non-existent icons with available alternatives:
  - BatteryChargingFull → Battery5Bar
  - BatteryStd → Battery1Bar
  - BatteryUnknown → BatteryAlert
  - Battery0Bar → BatteryUnknown
  - Error → Warning
  - QrCode → QrCodeScanner

## Running the Tests

Now that the UI compilation issues are fixed, you should be able to run the unit tests for your domain layer:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

The tests should now run successfully and provide feedback on the core business logic of your application.

## Next Steps

1. **Review test results** to verify that your domain layer behaves as expected
2. **Add additional tests** for ViewModel classes using similar patterns
3. **Create UI tests** using Compose testing libraries
4. **Set up CI/CD** to run tests automatically
