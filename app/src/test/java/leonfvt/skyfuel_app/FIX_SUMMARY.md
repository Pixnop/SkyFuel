# SkyFuel App Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Material Icons Issues

Replaced missing or unavailable Material icons:

- `BatteryChargingFull` → `Battery5Bar`
- `BatteryStd` → `Battery1Bar`
- `BatteryUnknown` → `BatteryAlert` (in some places)
- `Battery0Bar` → `BatteryUnknown`
- `BoltOn` → `ElectricBolt`
- `Error` → `Warning`
- `QrCode` → `QrCodeScanner`

### 2. Added Missing Imports

Added necessary imports for layout modifiers:
- `import androidx.compose.foundation.background`
- `import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Arrangement`

### 3. Java Time API Support for Older Android Versions

Added support for Java 8 APIs (java.time package) on older Android versions through:

1. Added Java 8 desugaring support in build.gradle.kts:
   ```kotlin
   compileOptions {
       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
   }
   ```

2. Added the desugaring dependency:
   ```kotlin
   coreLibraryDesugaring(libs.desugar.jdk.libs)
   ```

3. Added ThreeTenABP as a backup solution:
   ```kotlin
   // ThreeTen Android Backport - for java.time support on older Android versions
   implementation(libs.threetenabp)
   ```

4. Updated SkyFuelApplication to initialize ThreeTenABP:
   ```kotlin
   override fun onCreate() {
       super.onCreate()
       // Initialize ThreeTenABP for java.time API support on older Android versions
       AndroidThreeTen.init(this)
   }
   ```

## Remaining Issues

There may still be other UI-related issues such as:

1. PullRefresh Issues in HomeScreen
   - These require additional changes to implement the proper PullRefreshIndicator

2. Destructuring Issues
   - Some components are using destructuring with ambiguous pair types

## How to Run Tests

With these changes, you should now be able to:

1. Sync the project with Gradle
2. Run the unit tests with:
   ```
   ./gradlew test
   ```

The primary issues have been fixed, but there might still be minor compilation problems that need to be addressed based on specific implementation details.

## Further Code Improvements

For future development, consider:

1. Using explicit type declarations for destructured pairs:
   ```kotlin
   // Instead of:
   val (icon, text) = pair
   
   // Use:
   val iconAndText: Pair<ImageVector, String> = pair
   val icon = iconAndText.first
   val text = iconAndText.second
   ```

2. Using Material 3 specific components when available
3. Adding comprehensive tests following the existing test patterns
