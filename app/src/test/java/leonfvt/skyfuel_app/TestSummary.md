# SkyFuel App - Unit Tests

## Tests Created

### Repository Implementation
- Created a mock implementation of the `BatteryRepository` interface for testing (`FakeBatteryRepository`)
  - Implements all repository methods with in-memory storage
  - Simulates database operations without requiring actual database
  - Provides helper methods for test setup and verification

### Use Case Tests
1. **AddBatteryUseCase**
   - Tests valid battery addition with correct parameters
   - Verifies validation logic for empty fields and invalid values (brand, model, serialNumber)
   - Tests validation for numeric values (cells, capacity)
   - Ensures battery is saved with proper default values (status, cycleCount)

2. **GetBatteryDetailUseCase**
   - Tests retrieving battery by ID
   - Verifies null is returned for non-existent batteries
   - Tests behavior after battery deletion and updates
   - Validates that the returned battery contains the correct data

3. **GetAllBatteriesUseCase**
   - Tests retrieving empty list when no batteries exist
   - Tests retrieving multiple batteries
   - Verifies flow updates when batteries are added, modified, or deleted
   - Tests that the flow emits the latest values after changes

4. **UpdateBatteryStatusUseCase**
   - Tests status change updates the battery correctly
   - Verifies history entries are created with proper notes
   - Tests behavior with multiple status updates
   - Ensures non-existent battery IDs are handled gracefully
   - Validates that history entries are created for status changes

### Domain Model Tests
- **Battery Class**
  - Tests age calculation logic
  - Tests health percentage calculation based on cycle count and age
  - Tests health calculation for different battery types (degradation rates)
  - Tests "should be charged" logic for different scenarios
  - Tests edge cases like new batteries and very old batteries

## Compilation Issues

The unit tests cannot currently be run due to compilation issues in the presentation layer. These issues must be fixed before tests can be executed:

### Material Icons Issues
Several UI components reference Material icons that are missing:
- `BatteryChargingFull`, `BatteryStd`, `BatteryUnknown` in `BatteryActions.kt`
- `BoltOn` in `BatteryHistoryList.kt`
- `Battery0Bar` in `HomeScreen.kt` and `BatteryDetailScreen.kt`

We've attempted to fix this by adding the Material Icons Extended dependency:
```kotlin
implementation(libs.androidx.material.icons.extended)
```

### PullRefresh Issues
The `HomeScreen.kt` file has issues with the pull-to-refresh implementation:
- Missing `isRefreshing` and `endRefresh` properties
- Incorrect arguments for `PullRefreshIndicator`

### Other UI Issues
- `background` modifier is missing in `BatteryDetailHeader.kt`
- `size` modifier is missing in `FilterSection.kt`
- Component destructuring issues in `BatteryHistoryList.kt`

## Running Tests Recommendation

To run these tests, we recommend:

1. Fix the UI compilation issues first:
   - Ensure Material Icons Extended dependency is correctly added
   - Import the correct modifier extensions (background, size)
   - Fix the PullRefreshIndicator implementation
   - Resolve destructuring issues by explicitly typing the pairs

2. Run tests with Gradle:
```
./gradlew test
```

Alternatively, create a separate module that doesn't depend on the UI components to test just the domain layer.

## Test Coverage

The created tests cover the core business logic in the domain layer:
- Data validation (input validation for adding batteries)
- Status management (updating battery status and history tracking)
- Battery health calculation (health percentage based on type, age, and cycles)
- Age and maintenance timing logic (determining when batteries need attention)

## Next Steps

1. Fix UI compilation issues:
   - Add missing imports for Material icons
   - Fix RefreshIndicator implementation in HomeScreen
   - Add correct imports for missing modifiers

2. Create tests for ViewModel classes:
   - `HomeViewModel`
   - `BatteryDetailViewModel`
   - `AddBatteryViewModel`

3. Additional test coverage:
   - Integration tests for the data layer
   - UI tests for Compose screens
   - End-to-end flow tests
